# Configuration
The `template` contains a listing of contexts, which will be added to relations. A context defines an application in which the user's privileges will be evaulated. For instance, if the context is `inventory`, then the roles and actions listed within the context correspond to a user's ability to use or add to `inventory`.

The context consists of roles, and which actions they are allowed to perform. Please see the `test/permission.json` for an example.
